Google developed Angular, an open-source JavaScript-based framework for developing single-page to enterprise-level apps.

According to Statista, Angular has a market share of 22.96 percent among the most prominent web frameworks used by developers globally as of December 2021, making it one of the most popular web frameworks. It makes use of TypeScript to write statically-typed and object oriented code. Additionally,  developers can create components that can be reused, allowing for greater scalability.

Angular releases a [roadmap](https://angular.io/guide/roadmap) every few months to give developers an idea of what's to come. Prior to rolling out a new major version, the team receives requests for additional functionality and features from the developer community. In November of 2021, the angular team published version 13 of its open-source web application development framework.

Many businesses have already upgraded their Angular-based web apps to v13.

Angular development will not end with this version. According to their [release policy](https://angular.io/guide/releases), they will continue to release significant changes every six months. Therefore, we may assume that Angular's next major release will follow in June 2022.

Angular's most significant qualities include:

- The framework leverages HTML, an easy-to-learn and -use template language.
It is based on MVC architecture, which helps to simplify the code structure.
- It has data binding and routing capabilities that facilitate web development.
- Angular is a versatile framework that may be used based on the project's scope.


The introduction of Angular v13 by Google was more of an incremental update. It received little exposure. On the other hand, Angular 14 is making tremendous anticipation ahead to its release. It is expected to be a significant progress in the web development industry.

Here are some features of Angular 14:

## The new features of Angular 14

Angular 14, the next significant update to the popular Google-developed TypeScript-based web framework, will include fully typed reactive forms and expanded template diagnostics. With addition, modules will become optional in the June release.


## Typed reactive forms

Angular 14 provided an improvement to the reactive forms which is type-checking that will be more convenient and versatile than ever before. Angular's goal is to create a system that can be used with different Angular versions in the future. Doing so will not result in a backwards step.

This will help programmers to catch mistakes early on, which will save them a lot of work in the long run.

## Angular CLI Auto Completion

Ng completion is a new feature added in angular cli version 14 that enables developers to add real-time type ahead auto completion to their bash or zsh terminals.

The first time you must execute the `ng completion` command in your terminal.

You can just type `ng` command then press **Tab** to view all of the possible choices and **Enter** to choose one of them, moreover if we are working on an angular 14 project more auto completion options, such as the `ng generate` command options, are available.


## Optional angular modules and standalone components

Angular apps are mainly organized as modules that can be categorized into core, shared and feature modules 
This prevents the usage of directives, pipelines, and even components that are not within the scope of modules. Because modules are building blocks in Angular, the development experience is not always so pleasant especially for small apps that don't need modules but a small set of components.

As a result, efforts will be made to decouple components from modules. Components, directives, and pipes would be foundational to the framework instead of modules. This will enable developers to directly import components, directives, and pipes.

Angular 14 will advance the usage of standalone components and make NgModules optional. The objective is to move Angular in a path where pipes, directives, and components are increasingly significant and self-contained.

## Extended template diagnostics

Extended template diagnostics inside the compiler would prevent programmers from encountering frequent problems. 

Currently, the compiler does not offer any warnings and often fails solely on flaws that directly block compilation. 

Extended diagnostics will make it simple to provide warnings for lesser errors, such as inverting two-way binding syntax or using unnecessary operators. A new private flag in the compiler would allow diagnostic tests that provide information/warning diagnostics for user templates that do not strictly result in fatal errors.

# Angular Material Enhancements by Integration of MDC Web


The Google material design team built the MDC web library, which enables the re-use of Material Design primitives for developing components. The Angular team is now prepared to add these primitives to Angular Material for material design.

This will allow the Angular material to correspond more closely with the MDC website designs. This Material Design Specification allows you to increase accessibility, enhance component quality, and accelerate the Angular internal team.

Other Important enhancements planned to be included in the upcoming major versions are:

- Following the transition to Ivy, Angular is expected to eliminate the traditional View Engine in order to decrease conceptual overhead, package size, cost of maintenance, and complexity.
- Advanced compiler diagnostics to expand the Angular compiler's diagnostics beyond type checking.
- Additional accuracy and compliance tests may be implemented to strengthen the correctness guarantee.
- The angular team is in the process of migrating the codebase to the angular/angular mono repository in order to better the interaction of Angular DevTools with the framework.

## Micro frontend architecture & angular 14

Another significant, if not the most significant, change that Angular 14 will most probably include is the Micro Frontend Architecture. The angular team is aiming towards  independent deployment and the creation of large-scale applications. They want to increase the framework's efficiency and efficiency using Micro Frontend Architecture.

Angular has previously claimed that the community has a strategy in place to enable micro frontends. However, they are now doing research to determine the best abstraction to provide help. So we may deduce that the micro frontend will be available with v14 or a later release. But it will undoubtedly arrive shortly.

## Conclusion

The performance of Angular will be improved as a result of this projected Angular 14. From the sounds of it, Angular 14 will be a powerhouse. The Micro Frontend upgrade, on the other hand, is something to keep an eye on. I'm not sure whether it will be included in v14 or any following releases. Still, I'm optimistic that Angular will one day be capable of performing things that aren't even expected of it now.
